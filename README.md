## Resume Builder | React

## About

This project is a resume builder web application built with React.js. It allows users to create professional resumes by filling out a user-friendly form, previewing the result in real-time, and exporting the resume as a PDF.

This project demonstrates my skills in web development, UI/UX design, and state management using React and Redux.
